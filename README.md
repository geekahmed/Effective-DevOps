# Chapter 1. The Big Picture
- Devops is a way of thinking and a way of working.
	- It is a framework for sharing stories and developing empathy, enabling people and teams to practice their crafts in effective and lasting ways.
## A Snapshot of Devops Culture
- Etsy's process of devops make the new engineer able to get involved quickly in the work process.
## The Evolution of Culture
- Buy-in from management, freedom to experiment and work on non-customer-facing code, and trust across various teams all allowed these tools to be deployed and along with them, a culture of tooling, sharing, and collaboration.
## The Value of the Story
- Each of us thinks our own thoughts. Our concepts we share.
- It is important to link between abstract cultural practices and real-world experiences in order to draw from them.
# Chapter 2. What Is Devops?
- Devops is a cultural movement that changes
	- how individuals think about their work
	- values the diversity of work done
	- supports intentional processes that accelerate the rate by which businesses realize value
	- measures the effect of social and technical change
## A Prescription for Culture
- Devops is about finding ways to adapt and innovate social structure, culture, and technology together in order to work more effectively.
## The Devops Equation
- A sustainable, successful business is more than the development and operations teams.
- Limiting our thinking to just those teams who write software or deploy it into production does the entire business a disservice.
### Devops as Folk Model
- DevOps has become a folk model, a term used with different intent that leads to miscommunication and misunderstanding.
### The Old View and the New View
- In an environment where humans are blamed and punished for errors, a culture of fear can build up walls that prevent clear communication and transparency.
- Contrast this with a blameless environment, where issues are addressed cooperatively and viewed as learning opportunities for individuals and the organization.
### The Devops Compact
- The heart of devops starts with people working not only as groups but as teams with a desire for mutual understanding.
